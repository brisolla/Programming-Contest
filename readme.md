# Programming Contests

Here I share my tries on solutions for problems of some programming competitions. I had some of these source files lost in some 
backup external hard drives, so every time I found an "new" one, I will add it here.

### ACM - International Collegiate Programming Contest
It is an programming competition between universities around the world. Me and my friends used to participate between 
2007 and 2010 during the Computer Science course. Unfortunately, these specifics sources of that time we don't have it anymore.

### Google Code Jam
Annually, the google code jam test programmers from different countries to test their skills on algorithms, 
it is very fun.

### Google Hash Code 
It is a group competition to try to find the algorithm that reach the best result, there is no way to solve all inputs, 
your algorithm will try to maximize the score choosing some of the inputs.
